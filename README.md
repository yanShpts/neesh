# Yannis Shpits & Jacob Kavanal

**Problem Statement**  
Ever had an argument with a friend about the uniqueness of your interests? It can be difficult to find an unbiased representation of how the things you like stack up against that of your friends.

**Functionality**  
Neesh is a program that allows users to discover how niche their interests are. It utilizes Google Trends data to assign scores to an interest provided by a user.  

**Applications**
- GUI Development 
- Web Development

**Plan and Approach**  
-
**Frontend**  
We will be using the TKinter GUI Framework for the frontend, where users will input their interest into a text box. We will also present a list of a user's past few interests that they've input, as well as a leaderboard of the "most niche" interests. 

**Backend**

We will be utilizing the PyTrends API to attain trend information from Google Trends. This information will be used to create an comprehensive score that increases as a users interest becomes more niche.
